Because many metal parts move quickly and rub together inside the engine, all these frictions generate a lot of heat. The engine relies on coolant to keep these parts cool, so they will not overheat, but, The coolant can not only keep it cool, but the heat from the metal parts is transferred to the coolant. The only way for the coolant to remove this heat is to circulate through the radiator. The function of the radiator is to take the heat out of the coolant and release it. Into the air blown by the fan, then the coolant circulates back to the engine and cools the components again.","","Water cooling system radiator","Many cars use water cooling devices to dissipate heat from the engine. The water cooling system of the engine is mainly composed of a water pump, a radiator, a cooling fan, a thermostat, a water jacket in the engine block and a cylinder head, etc. The layout of automobile radiators is constantly adapting to new developments. The core of the fin-type radiator is composed of many thin cooling tubes and radiating fins. Many metal radiating fins are placed on the outer jacket of the cooling tube to increase the heat dissipation area and the rigidity and strength of the radiator itself. Let the coolant flow through, use the coolant as a medium to transfer heat from the machine parts to the coolant, rely on the flow of the coolant to send the heat away, and then dissipate it to the atmosphere, thereby reducing the temperature of the engine, and the coolant after the heat is dissipated. Then flow back to the heated parts. So as to complete the heat exchange between the coolant and the air and the heat sink, absorb the heat, and then transfer the heat to a remote place through various methods, such as the air in the case, and then the case transfers the hot air to the outside of the case, thus completing Heat dissipation of the car.","","Steps to flush the car radiator:","Drain the coolant first.

Although there are many auto parts, radiators are very important. The performance of its performance directly affects the performance of the car. If there is a problem with the car radiator, if it is not found and resolved in time, it may cause irreparable damage to the car. What are the factors that affect the performance of automobile radiators? Let\'s take a look.","1. Automobile radiators are made of metal materials, and should not be in contact with corrosive substances such as acids and alkalis, which will cause damage to their structure.","2. The internal structure of the car radiator is not easy to clean, even if there is dirt, it is not easy to be found, so the generation of dirt should be avoided. When choosing water, soft water must be used, and hard water must be treated before use.","3. The antifreeze used must be formal, otherwise it may corrode the radiator.","4. If you park for a long time in winter, be sure to keep the water clean, otherwise it may freeze.","5. Regular cleaning, this is a more practical method to prevent dirt clogging.","The performance of the car radiator is better, then the car feels better. Therefore, whether it is inspection work or prevention work, you should do it on time, and you ca n\u2019t wait for the problem to happen before you solve it. This is just a downside."]},{"date":"Nov 03, 2021","title":"Radiator Performance Index","img":"18.webp","des":"The higher the heat transfer coefficient of the same material radiator, the better its thermal performance.","view":"106","content":["Thermal performance","The higher the heat transfer coefficient of the same material radiator, the better its thermal performance. Can be used to increase the heat dissipation area of the outer wall (with wings (ribs)), increase the flow speed of the air around the radiator (such as a steel radiator with a cover), and strengthen the radiation intensity of the external surface of the radiator (such as the outer surface decorated with a radiation coefficient High coatings) and reducing the thermal resistance between the various parts of the radiator (such as the steel tube and string of steel string radiators) to improve the thermal performance of the radiator.","","Economic Indicators","The lower the unit heat dissipation cost (yuan / W), the lower the installation cost, the longer the service life, and the better the economy. The higher the metal thermal strength of a radiator of the same material (the amount of heat per unit mass of metal and the amount of heat radiation per unit temperature difference (in W / (kg \xb7 \xb0 C))), the better the economy.","","Requirements for installation and use","The radiator should have a certain mechanical strength and pressure bearing capacity, should be easy to install and combine to form the required heat dissipation area; the size should be small, occupying less room area and space; the installation and use process is not easy to break; the manufacturing process is simple and suitable Mass production.","","Hygiene and aesthetic requirements","The surface of the radiator should be smooth and easy to remove dust; the appearance should be beautiful and coordinate with the room decoration.",""]},{"date":"Nov 02, 2021","title":"Electronic Radiator Is A Device For Accelerating The Heat Emission Of Heating...","img":"19.webp","des":"An electronic radiator is a device that accelerates the dissipation of heat from a heating body. There are two points to measuring the quality of a radiator","view":"106","content":["An electronic radiator is a device that accelerates the dissipation of heat from a heating body. There are two points to measuring the quality of a radiator: heat dissipation and silence. Integrated circuits are used extensively in computer components. As we all know, high temperature is the enemy of integrated circuits. High temperature will not only cause the system to run erratically, shorten the service life, or even burn certain parts. The heat that causes high temperatures does not come from outside the computer, but from inside the computer, or inside the integrated circuit. The role of the electronic heat sink is to absorb this heat and then radiate it to the inside or outside of the case to ensure that the temperature of the computer components is normal. Most heat sinks absorb heat by contacting the surface of the heat-generating component, and then transfer the heat to a distance by various methods, such as the air in the case, and then the case transmits the hot air to the outside of the case to complete the heat dissipation of the computer.","","Surface quality requirements for radiators","1.1 The surface of the heat sink should be free of defects such as shrinkage, rust, and cracks;","1.2 The metal fasteners (plate, gland, disc spring) of the flat plate radiator, and the conductive sheet of the water-cooled radiator should be protected by plating;","1.3 The maximum allowable value of the surface roughness Ra of the heat sink table is 3.2, m;","1.4 The flatness of the heat sink table is not less than 9;","1.5 The surface of the heat sink (including heat sink, fasteners and insulation) for wet tropical power semiconductor devices should be protected, and its ability to withstand humidity, salt spray and mildew should conform to the corresponding tropical power semiconductor devices standard;","1.6 Fasteners and insulation parts for heat sinks shall comply with GBB446.3 (Radiator insulation parts and fasteners for power semiconductor devices \\"","1.7 The tightening torque or tightening pressure of the heat sink and power semiconductor installation should comply with the relevant provisions of the device product standard;","1.8 Plate-shaped heat sink table installation center positioning pin size: 2.5mm in diameter, higher than the table lmmo","","Requirements for the use of environmental conditions","2.1 There should be certain requirements for the water quality of the cooling water. The resistivity of the circulating water should not be lower than 2.5Ki2, and the PH value should be between 6} 9; the temperature of the inlet water should not be higher than 35 \u2103, and the water flow rate should be 4-8L / min;","2.2 When used in high voltage or higher voltage devices, the above water quality requirements or higher water quality requirements must be ensured;","2.3 When working on water-cooled radiators, special attention should be paid to preventing water leakage, blocking, and condensation.","2.4 When the air-cooled radiator is installed, the radiator blades should be along the cooling air flow direction; the inlet air temperature is not higher than 400C, and the inlet wind speed is 4-6mls;","2.5 Because the air-cooled radiator has the characteristics of wind resistance parameters, when selecting the radiator in the whole machine, you should check the relationship between the radiator\'s thermal resistance, flow resistance and wind speed according to the load requirements and fan capacity, and consider the heat resistance and Two parameters of wind resistance.","","Harm and Identification of Inferior Radiator","There are a large number of low-quality and low-quality heat sinks on the market. This kind of heat sink has a large gap from the national industry standard in terms of heat sink material, processing requirements, component quality, etc., and the life of the device in use And the overall quality has a greater impact. Users can identify from the following aspects when selecting:","3.1 The quality of the material (purity, thickness, processing accuracy, etc.) and manufacturing process (cracks, shrinkage holes, etc. produced by casting), poor materials and rough and defective processes will directly affect the thermal conductivity of the radiator;","3.2 The surface roughness and flatness of the radiator contact table directly affect the contact thermal resistance and pressure drop;","3.3 The disc springs for radiators should be stable after being flattened for 24 hours, otherwise the springs may fail after a period of use, which will cause poor contact between the radiator and the core.","","Matters needing attention when reusing radiator replacement elements","When installing a radiator, a large amount of pressure or torque is required. Since the diameter of the heat sink table is larger than the diameter of the tube core, the heat sink table must be deformed under the effect of this pressure or moment. If the same or larger diameter die is installed on the heat sink, the contact condition between the table surface and the die surface will be poor, and good heat dissipation effect cannot be guaranteed.","If the user needs to reuse the heat sink, it is necessary to ensure that the surface roughness, parallelism and flatness of the heat sink table meet the requirements, otherwise the device will be easily damaged by overheating during operation. Especially for water-cooled series radiators, be sure to carefully check the deformation of the table surface before reuse. If there is obvious sinking, replace it.","In order to ensure good heat dissipation conditions, each die should have a corresponding heat sink matching.","","Prevention of condensation on SS series radiators","In the hot and humid season, the water-cooled radiator is prone to condensation. If you do not pay attention, it will easily cause the equipment insulation to fall and cause short-circuit failure. For most environments, the following precautions need to be taken to prevent condensation."]},{"date":"Nov 01, 2021","title":"The Design Principle Of Electronic Radiator","img":"20.webp","des":"Many people have consulted about the design principles of electronic radiators.

Come and see:","In the thermal planning of electronic equipment, profile radiators are widely used because of their simple structure, convenient processing, and good heat dissipation effect. It consists of ribs and base. The first few parameters include rib length, rib thickness, number of ribs, base thickness, and base width. When selecting a radiator, it is generally necessary to choose it reasonably according to the heat resistance of the radiator. At the same time, the following points need to be considered: the space allowed by the radiator of the device, the air flow rate and the cost of the radiator. The heat dissipation effect of the radiator is closely related to the size of the heat resistance of the radiator, and the heat resistance of the radiator is not only related to the material of the radiator, but also related to the shape and size of the radiator, the installation method and the environmental ventilation conditions There is no accurate mathematical expression that can be used to calculate the thermal resistance of the heat sink, which is usually obtained by actual measurement. The useful area of the radiator is closely related to several parameters of the radiator."]}]')}}]);
