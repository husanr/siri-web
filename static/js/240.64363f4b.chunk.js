We can be divided into two areas according to different requirements for heating, namely traditional heating area and emerging heating area. The traditional heating area refers to the area along the Yellow River and north of it. The temperature in winter is very low and lasts for more than 4 months. You cannot live without heating. The emerging heating area is very wide, and the temperature in winter is relatively low and the duration is relatively short. If there is no heating, the quality of life is poor. Therefore, with the improvement of living standards, various heating equipment is also used for heating in winter.","","In traditional heating areas, heating mainly relies on central heating systems. In this system, the heat sources are mainly thermal power stations, boiler rooms, large heat pumps, etc. The heat medium is hot water or steam followed by hot water (secondary heat exchange), etc. The outdoor water or steam pipelines are generally steel pipes. Steel pipes are easy to rust, so use acid or alkali to remove rust. However, the steel pipe rusts faster after acid rust removal, and the effect of alkali rust removal is better, so it is generally believed that alkali has a protective effect on steel pipe rust. Under this concept, the system administrator will intentionally or unintentionally increase the alkalinity of heating hot water, for example, use the highly alkaline water after descaling as heating hot water directly, or add alkali to the heating hot water , To prevent users from misappropriating hot water. In fact, the most important factor that causes the steel pipe to rust is the dissolved oxygen in the hot water for heating or the air oxygen in the pipeline, so deoxidizing and blocking oxygen is the key to anticorrosion of the steel pipe. The more alkaline water not only pollutes the environment, shortens the life of various radiators and heat metering and control instrumentation equipment, but also has a certain degree of corrosion on the steel pipe itself. Therefore, the central and foreign management heating systems of the central heating system are neutral or weakly alkaline (generally PH value is 6 to 8.5), and there are special deaeration equipment in the system, and it must be a closed system. Full water maintenance, fully deoxidize and block oxygen. In this standard system, most radiators can be used well, and European aluminum radiators not only have a large heat dissipation but also have a unique air guide structure, which does not smoke tops or walls, So it is one of the most ideal radiators."]},{"date":"Nov 22, 2021","title":"How should the radiator be cleaned?","img":"05.webp","des":"When the surface of the car radiator is relatively dirty, it needs to be cleaned, generally once every 3W kilometers!","view":"104","content":["When the surface of the car radiator is relatively dirty, it needs to be cleaned, generally once every 3W kilometers!

The empty knife should be symmetrical up and down, left and right, and in the middle. The machining error between the teeth must be small. If the machining error is large, it is easy to produce partial teeth, that is, the thickness of the heat sink is not uniform, and even the teeth will be broken.",""]},{"date":"Nov 02, 2021","title":"Brief Introduction Of Extrusion Requirements Of Aluminum Radiator","img":"19.webp","des":"The key to the production of radiator profile is the first trial of extrusion die.

If possible, it is better to do simulation test on the computer to see whether the working belt of die design is reasonable, and then try the die on the extruder.","The first die test is very important. The operator should make the main plunger move forward and move slowly under the low pressure of less than 8Mpa when pressing up. It is better for someone to look after the die outlet with a flashlight. After each heat sink of the extrusion die is extruded out of the die hole evenly, the extrusion can be accelerated gradually.","When the extrusion continues after the successful die test, attention should be paid to control the extrusion speed to achieve smooth operation. Attention should be paid to the heating temperature of the mold when producing the radiator profile, so that the mold temperature is close to the ingot temperature. If the temperature difference is too large, because the extrusion speed is slow, the metal temperature will drop, and it is easy to produce the phenomenon of mold plugging or uneven flow velocity."]},{"date":"Dec 29, 2021","title":"What Is The Use Of Aluminum Radiator For Oxidation","img":"20.webp","des":"The phenomenon that the surface of metal has chemical or electrochemical action with the surrounding medium, which causes the metal to be damaged, is usually called metal corrosion.","view":"105","content":["The phenomenon that the surface of metal has chemical or electrochemical action with the surrounding medium, which causes the metal to be damaged, is usually called metal corrosion. The corrosion of metals causes us great losses every year. One of the methods to prevent metal corrosion is to form a protective layer of oxide film on the surface of metal. Many metals have natural oxide film, but most of them can not play the role of protective layer.","Aluminum and aluminum alloy have the advantages of low density, high specific strength, good conductivity and thermal conductivity, easy forming, no low temperature brittleness, etc. it is a kind of light metal material with excellent comprehensive performance. At present, aluminum has been widely used in aerospace industry, building materials, vehicles, electronic products and other fields. Aluminum has a strong chemical affinity for oxygen, and its surface is always covered by a transparent oxide film in the atmosphere. However, the natural aluminum oxide film is very thin, only 4x10-3-5x10-3 \u03bc m, with high porosity, low mechanical strength, and the corrosion resistance and wear resistance can not meet the needs of corrosion protection. Taking aluminum profile radiator as an example, dense and high-quality oxide film can be formed on the surface of aluminum (or aluminum alloy) by electrochemical method, and the thickness of the film can reach tens to hundreds of microns, which can effectively improve the corrosion resistance of aluminum. This electrochemical process is called anodic oxidation of aluminum. In addition, because the oxide film has uniform pores, it can also be dyed with organic dyes, and the color is stable after sealing, which makes the application of aluminum more widely."]}]')}}]);
