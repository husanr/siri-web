The phenomenon that the surface of metal has chemical or electrochemical action with the surrounding medium, which causes the metal to be damaged, is usually called metal corrosion. The corrosion of metals causes us great losses every year. One of the methods to prevent metal corrosion is to form a protective layer of oxide film on the surface of metal. Many metals have natural oxide film, but most of them can not play the role of protective layer.

Aluminum and aluminum alloy have the advantages of low density, high specific strength, good conductivity and thermal conductivity, easy forming, no low temperature brittleness, etc. it is a kind of light metal material with excellent comprehensive performance. At present, aluminum has been widely used in aerospace industry, building materials, vehicles, electronic products and other fields. Aluminum has a strong chemical affinity for oxygen, and its surface is always covered by a transparent oxide film in the atmosphere. However, the natural aluminum oxide film is very thin, only 4x10-3-5x10-3 Î¼ m, with high porosity, low mechanical strength, and the corrosion resistance and wear resistance can not meet the needs of corrosion protection. Taking aluminum profile radiator as an example, dense and high-quality oxide film can be formed on the surface of aluminum (or aluminum alloy) by electrochemical method, and the thickness of the film can reach tens to hundreds of microns, which can effectively improve the corrosion resistance of aluminum. This electrochemical process is called anodic oxidation of aluminum. In addition, because the oxide film has uniform pores, it can also be dyed with organic dyes, and the color is stable after sealing, which makes the application of aluminum more widely.
