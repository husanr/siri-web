01、SROXR-SUM005 SH340 HYDRAULIC ALUMINIUM PLATE AND BAR ENGINE OIL COOLER

	Bar & Plate Brazed Aluminum Core Rugged and Compact Best Heat Transfer for each given size Air-side fin design minimizes fouling

02、SROXR-SUM001 AUTO ENGINE OIL COOLER FOR SUMITOMO SH100 SH120

	Hydraulic oil cooler for construction machinery is widely used in kinds of construction machineries, such as excavator, tractor, farming machinery, concrete mixer, loader and so on.
03、SROXR-SUM002 SH210A5 SH210-5 AUTO ALUMINIUM PLATE AND BAR OIL COOLER FOR SUMITOMO
	
	There are several factors which effects the oil flow of the plate-fin heat exchanger of construction machinery, like thickness, height and spacing of the fins. It is not the larger of oil flow, the better heat dissipation effect.

04、SROXR-SUM003 SH240-5 HEAVY DUTY ALUMINIUM PLATE AND BAR ENGINE OIL COOLER FOR SUMITOMO

	In terms of structure, fins are added to the heat pipe to increase the heat dissipation area and speed up the heat transfer. Under the operation of the fan, air is used as the cold source to force heat away to achieve a low-cost and high-efficiency cooling effect, which meets the requirements of energy saving, water saving and environmental protection.

05、SROXR-SUM004 SH320 SH350-3/-5 SH360HD-5 AUTO OIL COOLER FOR SUMITOMO

	The oil cooler receives the heat of the lubricating oil and exchanges it with ambient air or radiator coolant. Usually it is automatic transmission oil that requires a dedicated oil cooler. It is common for vehicles to run on engine oil cooled by a separate exchanger.
